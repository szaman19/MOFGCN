# MOFGCN
An interpretable Graph Convolutional Model to achieve DFT level accuracy on Metal Organic Frameworks

### Graph Neural Network for Metal OrganicFramework Potential Energy Approximation

This repository will hold the models, pretrained models and complete dataset mentioned the NeurIPS 2020: ML for Molecules Workshop. 

We are currently working on uploading the data and code. It will be available shortly!
